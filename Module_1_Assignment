# Module 1 – Fundamentals

---
## 1. What is SDLC?

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process used for software development.
- It defines steps to build software systematically
- It helps in planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software
- It ensures quality, cost control, and timely delivery
- It reduces project risks and errors

---
## 2. What is Software Testing?

Software testing is the process of verifying and validating a software application.
- It checks whether the software meets user requirements
- It identifies defects or bugs in the application
- It ensures the software works correctly and reliably
- It improves software quality and performance

---
## 3. What is Agile Methodology?

Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible software development approach.
- Development is done in small cycles called sprints
- Customer feedback is taken frequently
- Continuous testing is performed
- Changes are accepted even in later stages
- Team collaboration is encouraged

---
## 4. What is SRS?

SRS (Software Requirement Specification) is a formal document that describes software requirements.
- Defines functional requirements
- Defines non-functional requirements
- Explains system behavior
- Mentions constraints and assumptions
- Acts as an agreement between client and development team

## 15. SDLC Phases with Basic Introduction

1. Requirement Analysis
- Understand and collect user needs
- Document requirements clearly before development 

2. Design
- Create system architecture and design models
- Decide database, UI, and technology stack

3. Development
- Developers write source code
- Features are implemented as per design

4. Testing 
- Test the application to find defects
- Ensure software meets requirements

5. Deployment 
- Release software to production environment
- Make it available to end users

6. Maintenance 
- Fix bugs after release
- Add updates and improvements

---
## 16. Phases of Waterfall Model

1. Requirement Analysis  
- Gather complete and fixed requirements
- No changes allowed after this phase

2. System Design  
- Prepare detailed system and software design
- Define hardware and software requirements

3. Implementation  
- Coding is done based on design
- Each module is developed separately

4. Testing  
- Test integrated modules
- Identify and fix defects

5. Deployment  
- Software is delivered to customer
- Installed in live environment

6. Maintenance  
- Handle issues after deployment
- Perform enhancements if required

---
## 17. Phases of Spiral Model

1. Planning  
- Define project objectives and requirements
- Plan resources and schedule

2. Risk Analysis
- Identify technical and business risks
- Reduce risks using prototypes
  
3. Engineering  
- Develop and test the software
- Implement planned features

4. Evaluation  
- Customer reviews the product
- Feedback is used for next cycle

---
## 18. Agile Manifesto Principles

1. Customer satisfaction 
- Deliver valuable software early and continuously

2. Welcome changing requirements  
- Changes are accepted even late in development

3. Frequent delivery  
- Working software is delivered regularly

4. Business & developer collaboration  
- Business people and developers work together daily

5. Working software  
- Working product is the main measure of progress

6. Face-to-face communication  
- Direct communication is preferred

7. Sustainable development  
- Maintain a constant development pace

8. Technical excellence  
- Good design improves agility

9. Simplicity  
- Focus on essential work only

10. Self-organizing teams  
- Teams manage their own work

11. Continuous improvement  
- Team regularly improves processes
